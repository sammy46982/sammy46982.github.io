      	<p> Here are a few photos of me racing my dirtbike. I have been riding since I was 5 years old and racing sinced I was 10 years old. I have traveled the east coast with my father competing against others. Ive earned sponsors, won championships, injured myself, and made many friends. Motocross is something that I will always love and have a passion for.
