        	After going to many fraternities rush events my 1st semester of freshman year, Theta Chi felt like home to me. They seemed like a great group of guys that cared about academics and cared for others. After joining, I leared a lot of the greek life and the history of the chapter. We are known as "resolute men" and are a military based fraternity. My second semester of freshman year I became house manager. For this upcoming elections, I was nominated for President, VP, and Marshall. We will see how it goes and I am excited to better myself in this chapter.
